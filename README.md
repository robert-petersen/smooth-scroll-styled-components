# Smooth Scrolling and Styled Components Application Walkthrough
Created a basic banking website using React, Styled Components, React Scroll, and React Icons. Application deployed using Vercel.
Check out the deployed <a href="https://smooth-scroll-styled-components.vercel.app/">website</a>.
This application is built from a walkthrough on youtube by Brian Design called "React Website using Styled Components and Smooth Scroll - Beginner Project Fully Responsive". I decided to use this walkthrough as an opportunity to learn the styled-components library as well as react-scroll and react-icons.
