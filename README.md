## Smooth Scrolling and Styled Components Application Walkthrough
This application is built from a walkthrough on youtube by Brian Design called "React Website using Styled Components and Smooth Scroll - Beginner Project Fully Responsive". I decided to use this walkthrough as an opportunity to learn the styled-components library as well as react-scroll and react-icons.
